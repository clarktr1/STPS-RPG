# 🏰 Save the Princess Simulator (STPS)

A retro-inspired **turn-based RPG** built from scratch, where the goal is simple: **Save the Princess** — or at least simulate the experience.

What started as a full-stack SQL-based web app quickly evolved into something much more fun than a grocery tracker. Built originally as a group capstone project, *Save the Princess Simulator* blends humor, challenge, and strategy — and eventually grew into a full-fledged RPG prototype.

## 🧠 About the Original Project

Original web-based game repo is [here]!https://github.com/clarktr1/Princess-Saving-Simulator)
**STP** began as a full-stack app designed to meet a basic spec: use SQL and session storage to track user data. Instead of building another workout tracker, we thought: _“What if we make a game instead?”_

### MVP Highlights

- User authentication & session storage
- Choose from **3 unique classes**, each with custom stats and movesets
- **Turn-based combat engine** built with pure JavaScript
- Art, game engine, and logic all handcrafted from the ground up
- Game state reset system for handling loss or restart

> The MVP of STP was built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, and — yes — a lot of debugging-induced headaches.

## Technology Stack

**Core Tech:**
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Node.js
- SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Session Storage

**Deployment:**
- Heroku (MVP)

**Extended Build:**
- [RPG Maker MV](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-mv)
- Custom JavaScript + Built-in scripting

## 🔄 Evolution of STP

After the initial team build, I continued development solo, expanding STP using **RPG Maker MV** to prototype a richer RPG experience. This version features:

- Enhanced visuals and effects
- Better enemy AI and encounter variety
- Smooth character/class selection
- Custom scripting for in-game systems

🧪 A playable build of this expanded version is available above!
